Global
------

* Add a plumbing selector.  Would make it possible to provide scripts
  that follow the same command-line options as 'git-home-history' but
  store files differently (some rsync+hardlink tools or tape archivers
  perhaps?)


GTK front-end
-------------

* Change the calendar+time widgets for an F-Spot style slider

* Have a nice tree view that expands on folders, not a plain list

* Add indicators that show when the commits were made.  Restrict
  selection to the commit date & times, instead of an open selection?

* Add nautilus/konqueror/others extensions to directly retrieve old
  versions in the filesystem browser

Plumbings - git-home-history
----------------------------

* daemon that watches for file change with inotify and commits when
  reaching a given amount of file changes.  (_that_ could be started
  at session startup)

* add "ghh give <dir_or_file> into <dir> [as of <timespec>]": get the
  dir_or_file checked out to a directory check if directory exists.
  if so tell user to move it, then checkout

* add a test script that would, in a test home directory, flex most of
  the options of git-home-history and report errors.  to be run before
  "make dist".  See the "t/" directory in the git source for example.
