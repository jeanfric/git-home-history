GTK front-end
-------------

* Add a proper .desktop entry that does the commit at login
  (see the autostart toggle)

* Add an option to drag and drop one or many files from the file list
  to nautilus/konqueror targets.  Would call "g-h-h show <file> as of
  <d>", where 'd' is the same date as of last calendar refresh.

* Add option to "commit now" in the frontend (and/or add a separate
  "commit" dialog -- could be a handy shortcut on the panel, for
  example)

* Add time selection, not only date selection

Plumbings
---------

* daemon that watches for file change with inotify and commits when
  reaching a given amount of file changes.  (_that_ could be started
  at session startup)

* add "ghh give <dir_or_file> into <dir> [as of <timespec>]": get the
  dir_or_file checked out to a directory check if directory exists.
  if so tell user to move it, then checkout

* add a test script that would, in a test home directory, flex most of
  the options of git-home-history and report errors.  to be run before
  "make dist".  See the "t/" directory in the git source for example.
